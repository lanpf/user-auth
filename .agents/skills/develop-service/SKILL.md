# Develop Service Code

## Workflow

1. Inspect the target module, nearby types, and existing public contracts.
2. Read `references/architecture.md` before creating or moving modules, packages, or configuration resources, and `references/dependency-rules.md` plus `references/service-baseline.md` when changing Maven dependencies or technology assembly.
3. Read `references/java-language.md`, `references/common-utilities.md`, and `references/constants-and-literals.md` for Java implementation and review.
4. Read `references/lombok.md`, `references/mapstruct.md`, and `references/logging.md` before changing Lombok annotations, object conversion, or log statements.
5. Read `references/validation-exceptions.md` when changing inputs, validation, or failures, and `references/error-codes.md` when defining or using error codes.
6. Read `references/naming.md` and `references/persistence-naming.md` before naming any new type, file, or query, and `references/resource-naming.md` before defining cache keys, resource keys, or namespaced configuration.
7. Read `references/api-domain-application.md`, `references/infrastructure-interfaces-boot.md`, and `references/data-carriers.md` before changing layer responsibilities or data carriers.
8. Read `references/persistence.md` before changing data access, transactions, or queries, and `references/distributed-id.md` before generating identifiers.
9. Read `references/project-documentation.md` before changing service responsibilities, cross-service collaboration contracts, delivery status statements, or the project documentation structure.
10. Write and run unit tests per `references/unit-testing.md`; integration tests belong to the smoke-test phase and are covered by `$test-integration`.
11. Preserve compatibility unless the task explicitly authorizes a breaking change.
12. Compile and run the narrowest relevant tests.

Prefer explicit, readable business logic. Treat every `required` rule as a release-blocking constraint.
