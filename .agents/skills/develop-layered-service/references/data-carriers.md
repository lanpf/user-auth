# Layered Data Carrier Rules

## API and domain

- **DATA-API-001** — Prefer records for API commands and queries, and always use records for API responses; these contracts are complete, immutable, and independent of HTTP binding and header injection. Use records for API events when serialization, RPC, OpenFeign, and client compatibility support immutable constructor binding.
- **DATA-API-COMPAT-001** — For public Java APIs, evaluate the binary-constructor compatibility impact before adding a record component.
- **DATA-DOMAIN-001** — Prefer records for domain IDs, value objects, effects, and immutable domain events when inheritance is unnecessary; use classes for aggregate roots, entities, framework bases, mutable state, and complex behavior.
- **DATA-INTERFACES-001** — Use ordinary mutable classes for interfaces HTTP requests so JSON binding and Client, Channel, or Device header injection can populate them; they may extend the required Client context type but must not be used as Facade inputs.

## Application and persistence

- **DATA-APPLICATION-001** — Prefer records for immutable application commands, command outputs, query conditions, and views; services, repositories, gateways, and mappers remain classes.
- **DATA-PERSISTENCE-001** — Read-only persistence projections may be records; DOs, JPA entities, and no-argument or setter-bound types remain classes.
