## Code structure

- **ERROR-FORMAT-001** — A complete error code has six digits: a three-digit service prefix plus a three-digit local code; error enums declare only the local code, and the framework composes and zero-pads the full code.
- **ERROR-CONTEXT-001** — One service project represents one bounded context and uses one unique service prefix; independently deployed bounded contexts require distinct prefixes.
- **ERROR-DOMAIN-001** — Allocate local codes `000-599` to `DomainError`: reserve `000-099` for shared domain errors and partition `100-599` into aligned 50-code blocks. Each aggregate is assigned one or more adjacent complete blocks according to its required capacity.
- **ERROR-DOMAIN-CAPACITY-001** — A 50-code block is the minimum allocation unit for aggregate errors. An aggregate exclusively owns every code in all of its assigned blocks and may use one or multiple adjacent blocks. Capacity expansion must reserve additional adjacent, currently unallocated complete blocks; blocks must not be split, shared, or reassigned between aggregates.
- **ERROR-APPLICATION-001** — Allocate local codes `600-699` to `ApplicationError` and prefix names with `APP_`.
- **ERROR-INFRA-001** — Allocate local codes `700-899` to `InfrastructureError`.
- **ERROR-INFRA-TECH-001** — Reserve `700-799` for failures of technical mechanisms owned by the service, such as local persistence, caching, locking, serialization, files, event storage, and outbox processing; prefix names with `INFRA_TECH_`.
- **ERROR-INFRA-ACL-001** — Reserve `800-899` for failures at external integration and anti-corruption boundaries, such as remote transport, authentication, protocol, unavailable providers, malformed responses, and provider-specific rejections that cannot be translated into local business semantics; prefix names with `INFRA_ACL_`.
- **ERROR-INFRA-TRANSLATION-001** — Translate an external rejection into `DomainError` or `ApplicationError` when it has a stable local business meaning; do not classify it as infrastructure solely because it originated from another system.
- **ERROR-RESERVED-001** — Keep local codes `900-999` reserved and unallocated.

## Domain allocation

- **ERROR-DOMAIN-COMMON-001** — Prefix shared domain errors with `DOMAIN_`; the first two are `DOMAIN_ENTITY_ID_INVALID` and `DOMAIN_EVENT_ID_REQUIRED`.
- **ERROR-AGGREGATE-001** — Prefix aggregate errors with the aggregate name; the first two are `{AGGREGATE}_NOT_FOUND` and `{AGGREGATE}_ALREADY_EXISTS`.
- **ERROR-RANGE-001** — Unallocated complete aggregate ranges remain available, but unused codes inside an assigned aggregate range remain owned by that aggregate and must not be reassigned.
- **ERROR-DOCUMENTATION-002** — Document the service prefix, shared-domain range, and every aggregate range in the authoritative domain document declared by the project documentation entry.

## Stability

- **ERROR-APPEND-001** — Append new errors in local-code order within the owning range.
- **ERROR-STABILITY-002** — Published error codes are immutable and must not be modified, reused, or assigned to a different meaning.
